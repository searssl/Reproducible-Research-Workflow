## Session 3. Version Control and Github

### What is version control  

Version control is a system to systematically record changes to files in a project, in such a way that it is always possible to recall specific versions of the files at any point in the life of the project. 
There are different reasons why version control is a valuable tool in reproducible research.

Having versions of a project is useful because it prevents error propagation. For instance, if changes are made in a coding project that introduce error (e.g., the analysis fails, the code breaks, etc.), it is always possible to retrieve files from a previous version before any questionable changes were completed.

Version control also allows projects to grow. For instance, there might be some common elements in different projects, say, data preprocessing, after which analysis can differ. Version control would allow multiple projects to branch from that common root with ease.

Version control can be done locally. 

In this case, files are stored in a local system and are identified by versions. The user can select which version to work with. A very simple way of doing version control is by naming files according to progression. Many of us will call a file "Document-Sept-19-2019", and then when we work on it again and make changes, save the new file as "Document-Oct-15-2019". This is a rudimentary and inefficient way of doing version control, given the proliferation of files and the difficulty of keeping track of changes.

Version control systems instead keep a database of files by version, while keeping track of changes.

Version control systems can also be centralized.

In this case, there is a version control server that serves versions of the project to one or more users, who also keep the project locally in their systems. An advantage of a centralized version control system is that it automatically provides backup for the project in the server. Another advantage is that a centralized system also makes it easy to collaborate with others - there will be more on this at a later session. 

In this session we will introduce some basic concepts and tools of version control.

### Software

Version control is implemented in a systematic way by different software applications. They include [PerForce](https://www.perforce.com/solutions/version-control), [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/), and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). For this seminar, we will use GitHub, a centralized version control system based on Git.

#### Git

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds (of Linux fame) after the source-control management system that he and his collaborators had been using during the creation of the Linux kernel changed the terms of use.

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(slang)) in British English slang means a contemptible and unpleasant person, and without much [argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpAvcGcEc0k) Torvalds called the project "the stupid content tracker". Git, like Linux, is an open source free project.

#### GitHub

GitHub is a hosting service for version control based on Git. It implements the functionality of Git and complements with additional features. As of 2019 it is reported to have 38 million users and at least 28 million public repositories, which makes it the world's largest host of source code - althought source code is only one class of information that GitHub serves.

For this seminar you will need to create an account with [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home). An account can be created for free which offers full functionality using public repositories. A GitHub Pro account is needed in order to keep private repositories, but for the purpose of this seminar you do not need it.

If you do not have an account yet, please create one now.

### So what can we do with a version control system?

Lets quickly tour GitHub.

#### Creating a repository

The starting point for using version control is to create a repository. See below:

![Create a Repository](Session-3-Figure-2.png)

You will need to choose a name for the repository and select the settings. See below:

![Repository Settings](Session-3-Figure-3.png)

The settings allow you to create a README.md document immediately, so that the repository is not empty.

#### Making and committing changes using the online editor

Any text files can be edited directly using the online editor:

![Edit a File Online](Session-3-Figure-4.png)

#### Review the history of a repository


![History of a Repository](Session-3-Figure-5.png)

#### Review version changes


### You can also be a little bit social using version control

Git and GitHub encourage interaction with creators and developers.

#### Fork a repository

A _fork_ is an original copy of a repository that can be used to experiment with changes without those changes being reflected in the original project. Forks are a practical way of using some project as the starting point to develop your own ideas. Forks can also be used to propose changes to the original project - for instance improvements or bug fixes.

Try forking this repository: https://github.com/paezha/Reproducible-Research-Workflow

#### Request a pull

When you wish to suggest changes to the owner of the repository, you can request a pull. It is up to the owner to accept the request or not.

For example:

Student Name | Last Name | Program
-|-|-
Elise | Desjardins | Physics
Jaila | Shamal | Geography
Ritchie | Lee | Chemistry
David | Ma | Chemistry
Megeen | Magee | Geography
John | Meral | Geography
Sear | Sean | Engineering
Rajveer | Ubhis | Geography
Tatiane | Ferrari | Economics
Fernando | Romero | Economics

### GitHub Desktop

In addition to creating an account with GitHub, you will need an app called GitHub Desktop, which can be downloaded [here](https://desktop.github.com/). This app allows you to interact with GitHub from your local system.

At this point, try launching the GitHub Desktop application, which will look like this:

![GitHub Desktop](Session-3-Figure-7.png)

#### Clone a repository

When a repository is created on GitHub, it first only exists remotely. To create a copy locally, you must _clone_ the repository. You can clone any public repositories, including obviously your own. The system will then synchronize the local version with the remote version.

![Clone a GitGub Repository](Session-3-Figure-8.png)

#### Workflow

The workflow with GitHub Desktop, once you have cloned a repository, is as follows:

1. Make changes to your project (i.e., edit files, create new files, delete files, etc.)

2. You can make multiple changes and save the files as appropriate. For instance, if you are editing an R Markdown file, you can save your changes, make some more, save again and so on

3. The version control system keeps tracks of the changes, but the changes do not become a new version of the repository locally until those changes have been _committed_. A _Commit_ needs a summary and a description of the changes. Sometimes the changes are small and the message does not need to be very detailed, but for major changes, a well-documented Commit Message makes it easier to understand what happened during the update to a new version

4. Once that the changes are commited, you have an updated version of the repository locally. The GitHub repository on the server, however, has not yet been updated. This is done by _Pushing_ your version to the remote GitHub repository. Now the local and remote versions of the project are synched

5. On the other hand, if there are changes to the remote repository (either because you worked online or someone else made/pushed changes to the repository), those changes are not reflected locally until you _Pull_ the changes

6. The system is designed so that you are not allowed to push changes if your local and remote versions of the repository are different. In that case, you will be asked to pull changes (so that the local version is in sync) before pushing any changes

7. The system will try to complete all changes seamlessly - but conflicts can happen! We will discuss conflicts in a later session when we talk about collaboration in more detail  
  
### Activity

1. Create a new repository and name it "My First Repository"

2. Create a README.md file for the repository

3. Clone the repository to your local system

4. Use R Studio to edit the README.md Ffile; use markdown syntax to introduce yourself and your repository

5. Copy the R Markdown note that you created in Activity 1 to your local repository

6. Use GitHub Desktop to track your changes locally, to commit them, and to push them to the GitHub repository

7. Once you have done this, email the link to your repository to both instructors.
